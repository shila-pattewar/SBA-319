//1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
// Realistic timelines, the right tools, and resources, and maintaining good communication, you can significantly reduce challenges during execution. Planning well also involves anticipating potential risks and remaining flexible enough to adapt when necessary.


//2. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
// Addressing potential challenges during the planning phase and leveraging the right tools and practices, you can reduce the difficulty of implementing complex requirements in future projects. Key strategies include thorough research, planning for scalability, using the right libraries, and implementing good development practices such as Agile and clear documentation.

//3. What would you add to or change about your application if given more time?
// If given more time to improve an application, improving performance, security, user experience, scalability, and maintainability would be some of the top priorities. There are several enhancements or adjustments that could be made to improve its functionality, performance, user experience, and overall maintainability. 

//4. Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
//Iterate and Improve: Donâ€™t be afraid to pivot your approach if you find better methods for solving problems. A major takeaway from this project is that software development is an ongoing learning process, and things rarely go as planned. Always seek feedback, keep improving, and remain adaptable.
